# TalkDeck
Read TweetDeck outloud!

## What?
This is a chrome extension that will read the Home tab from [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com) for you.
It will add two new buttons at the bottom of the columns selection list on the left:
- The first button starts/stop the voice
- The second button opens (on a new tab) the previously read tweet (in case you missed it or you want to review it)

## Where?
You need to have [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com) open, and the Home column visible.

## When?
It will rollout the latest 100 tweets (the current queue size is shown as a tooltip for the Play button).
So, anytime you want to listen, you will get up to 100 of the latest tweets.

## Why?
Well, I missed [The Social Radio](https://twitter.com/thesocialradio)
